# Lab-Activity
**Team Number:** 2  

## Overview  
This repository holds the six practical assignments developed using **Unity** and **Autodesk Maya** as part of our lab activities. Each practical demonstrates a concept or technique in game development, 3D modeling, animation, graphics, or interactive design.

 Each `PracticalX` folder contains the Unity project (or Maya files, or both) for that particular lab task.  

## Lab Practicals Summary  

Below is a brief description of each practical (you can fill in more details):

| Practical # | Tools Used    
|-------------|-------------------|
| Practical 6 | Unity / Maya
| Practical 7 | Unity             
| Practical 8 | Unity + Maya
| Practical 9 | Unity
| Practical 10 | Maya


## How to Run / Use  

### Unity Practicals  
1. Open Unity Hub.  
2. Add the directory of the specific `PracticalX` folder as a project or directly open it.  
3. Make sure you have the correct Unity version installed (matching the project version).  
4. In the Unity Editor, press **Play** to run the scene / game.  
5. Explore the scene and test interactions as per instructions inside that practical’s folder.

### Maya Practicals  
1. Open Autodesk Maya.  
2. Load the `.mb` / `.ma` file or project in the practical folder.  
3. Review the model / animation, play back the timeline, inspect rigging, etc.  
4. Any renders or exported files (e.g. `.fbx`) may also be included in that folder.

## Dependencies / Software Requirements  

- **Unity** (version: *specify version you used, e.g. 2022.3.x*)  
- **Autodesk Maya** (version: *specify version, e.g. 2023*)  
- If there are any additional Unity packages / plugins (e.g. Post Processing, TextMeshPro, etc.), list them here.  
- Any asset files (textures, models) should already be included in each practical’s folder.

## Contribution / Team Workflow  

- Our team is **Team 2**.  
- Each member may take one or more practicals to implement.  
- Use branches for new features or bug fixes; merge into `main` once stable.  
- Commit messages should be descriptive (e.g. “Practical3: added animation blending logic”).  
- Before submission, ensure the project runs cleanly without missing references/assets.

## Notes & Tips  

- Always check build settings (scene is included in build list) when exporting or packaging your project.  
- Keep asset files organized (e.g. separate folders for models, textures, materials).  
- For Unity projects, avoid absolute file paths—use project-relative paths or Unity’s asset workflow.  
- In Maya-based tasks, ensure proper naming conventions for rig hierarchies, material assignments, etc.
